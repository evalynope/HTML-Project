            <h2>Who is J.R.R. Tolkien?</h2>
            <p>J.R.R. Tolkien was an English writer and professor, best known for authoring The Hobbit, 
                The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and other related works which became a monumental 
                foundation to fantasy literature. He was a fellow of three colleges at Oxford, a member
                of the informal literary group 'The Inklings', and a close colleague of the scholar and author 
                C.S. Lewis. His works draw on themes such as friendship, folklore, and the struggle between 
                good and evil. Many regard his as the 'Father of modern fantasy.'
